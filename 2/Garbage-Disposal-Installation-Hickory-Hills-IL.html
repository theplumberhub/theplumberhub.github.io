This chooses every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working correctly, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you might run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check".
