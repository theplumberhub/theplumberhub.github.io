<p>Sinks aren't as basic as they used to be. Nowadays, property owners can pick from a dizzying range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, energy room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is usually a sign of a blockage in the plumbing system. If the obstruction isn't removed, water pressure can develop within the pipe, eventually causing it to burst.</p>
