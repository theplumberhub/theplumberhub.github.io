As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils.
