<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the firmness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
