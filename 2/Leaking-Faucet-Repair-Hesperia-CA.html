<p>First consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be necessary. Typically, relining your existing pipes is a better choice. If your sewer lines are below trees, near extensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can trigger a good deal of collateral damage (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>New shower drains develop strong seals that are less most likely to loosen up with time. A number of alternatives are terrific for tight spaces and permit fast installation.

Inspect the list of state licensing firms to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
