<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
