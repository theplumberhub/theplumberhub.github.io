<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust.
