If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your house may need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates if your house was built decades prior to that.</p>
<p>Lots of homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their dirty or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and affordable, but they damage your pipes and their results are only short term.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
