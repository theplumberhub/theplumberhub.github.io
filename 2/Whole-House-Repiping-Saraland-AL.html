<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
