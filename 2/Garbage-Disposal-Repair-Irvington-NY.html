How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you should first get the needed license( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page for more information on acquiring a permit. As soon as you obtain a permit you can start with the work. However, you must require inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>

<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce serious drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for normal house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
