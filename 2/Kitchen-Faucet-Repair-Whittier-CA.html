<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
