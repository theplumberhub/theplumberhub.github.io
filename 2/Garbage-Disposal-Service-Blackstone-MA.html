Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis.
