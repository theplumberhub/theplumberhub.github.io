<p>The water used to regrow the softener beads winds up as waste. Other signs that your drain line should be cleaned consist of strange smells originating from the drain itself, reduced water pressure from the tap, or overruning water or waste from a sink or toilet.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
