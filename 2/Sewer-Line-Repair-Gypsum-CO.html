Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
