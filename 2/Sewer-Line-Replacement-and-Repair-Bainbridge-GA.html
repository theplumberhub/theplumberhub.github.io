<h3>Drain Unblocking in Bainbridge Georgia</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller sized model that operated on the exact same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
