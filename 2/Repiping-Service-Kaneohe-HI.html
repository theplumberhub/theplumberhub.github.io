<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
