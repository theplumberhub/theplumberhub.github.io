For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
