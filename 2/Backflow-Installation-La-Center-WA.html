<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less crucial things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
