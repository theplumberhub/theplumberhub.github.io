<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
