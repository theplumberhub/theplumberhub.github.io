<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>A water heater leak can be a sign of a wide range of problems, all of which should be repaired instantly to prevent total home appliance failure. While it is possible to fix a hot water heater leak yourself, it can be a difficult job to detect the source of the water heater leak and repair it securely. Roto-Rooter plumbers are specialists at hot water heater leak repair.</p>
