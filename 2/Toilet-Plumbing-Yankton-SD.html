We provide a variety of options for homes and services that eliminate unwanted minerals and increase the efficiency of water associated home appliances. Intrusive tree roots can cause significant plumbing problems, particularly in older neighborhoods with clay sewer lines.</p>
<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by getting rid of an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these aspects not only dry your skin and hair but also build up in appliances and pipes minimizing their performance and life expectancy. Your washing dishwasher, machine and water heater are all negatively impacted by tough water. The results of tough water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothes, the film on your shower door and even your individual look and convenience.</p>
