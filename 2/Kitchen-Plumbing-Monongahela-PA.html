The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
