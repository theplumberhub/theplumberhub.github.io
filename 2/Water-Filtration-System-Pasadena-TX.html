<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Pasadena TX</h3>
<p>Contrary to what numerous think, having a waste disposal unit really safeguards your pipes and extends their life expectancy. Food washed down a drain accidentally or on function without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, triggering clogs and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a waste disposal unit wash directly down quickly.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This large amount of trash does not need to go in the trash bin if it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of trash that gets sent to land fills and other dumping locations. With a garbage disposal the garbage is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
