<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up throughout construction of a brand-new or refurbished structure is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.
