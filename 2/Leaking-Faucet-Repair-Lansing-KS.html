<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
