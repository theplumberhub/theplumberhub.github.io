<p>The typical toilet will last for decades and have very little problems that can be easily repaired without replacement. However, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is very important to have a licensed and experienced plumber manage the job.

Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
