<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
