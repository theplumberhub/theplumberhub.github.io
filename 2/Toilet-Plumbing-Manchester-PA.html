Some toilets, however, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not disperse your weight uniformly and might eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
