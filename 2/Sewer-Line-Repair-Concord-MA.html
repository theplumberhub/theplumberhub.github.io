<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Concord MA 01742</h3>
<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 made use of to eliminate wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the earliest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and replaceable sections, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>If you have actually cracked or broken drains till a video inspection is carried out, it's difficult to figure out. Broken or broken drains are normally preceded by repeating obstructions, constant nasty drain smells or the presence of sewer flies.

ZOOM DRAIN performs a complimentary peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
