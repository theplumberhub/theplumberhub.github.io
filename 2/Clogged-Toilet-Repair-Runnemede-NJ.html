<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then go back to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
