<p>Weird Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to travel through. Because of the tight space, the pipes frequently make odd gurgling sounds as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the odd noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
