<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can cause considerable problems. Even little leakages can gradually moisten walls and floors till they become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may become rusty and add rust to the water supply. Gurgling sound from pipes. A weird, gurgling sound coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a good indication. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not be enough to resolve this problem. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
<p>The cost to repipe a home with PEX tubing is $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot depending upon the size of the house and the level of replumbing you're doing.
