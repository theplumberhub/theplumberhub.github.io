<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Running out of hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
