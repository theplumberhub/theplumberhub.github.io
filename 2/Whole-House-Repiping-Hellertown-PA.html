<p>Turn the deal with counterclockwise if it ends up being hard to turn; it's most likely you have actually come across a clog. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Insert it back into the drain till you hit resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work some of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out periodically to remove debris until it moves past the obstruction without resistance.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
