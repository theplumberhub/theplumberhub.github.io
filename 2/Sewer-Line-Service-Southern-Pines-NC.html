Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
