<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just eliminates hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health.

Inspection services will resume on June 16, 2020.</p>
