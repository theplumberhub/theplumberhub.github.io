<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Saint Marys PA</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific evaluations and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
