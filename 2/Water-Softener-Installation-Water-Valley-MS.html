<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing.

Depending upon the scope of work being carried out and the kind of structure, you may have several inspections.</p>
