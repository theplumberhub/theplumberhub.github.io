<p>The usual service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually suffers from rust and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
