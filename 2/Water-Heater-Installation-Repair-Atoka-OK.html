Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair likewise called trenchless pipe lining is a exceptional and long lasting  alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and cracks. The liner is left to solidify in place for several hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. As soon as the process is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
