If the area is considered a restricted space, appropriate safety precautions should be followed for proper entry. A safe and proper work environment may entail the placement of security barriers or entry limitations around the workspace so the repair specialist or the public around your workspace are not damaged. This could impact the professional's capability to successfully complete the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area.</p>
