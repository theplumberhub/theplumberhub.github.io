<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
