<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them.

Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
