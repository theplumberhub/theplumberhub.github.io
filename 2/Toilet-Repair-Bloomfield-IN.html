<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>

<p>While pipe lining is an excellent option for the majority of people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only choice. Repiping is the procedure of replacing old corroded pipes with resilient and long-lasting brand-new pipes.

Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
