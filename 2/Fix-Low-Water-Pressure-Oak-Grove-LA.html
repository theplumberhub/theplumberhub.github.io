Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to address this concern. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>

The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
