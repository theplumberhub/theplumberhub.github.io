<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.
