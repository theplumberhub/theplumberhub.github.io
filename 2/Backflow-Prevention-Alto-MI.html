<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
