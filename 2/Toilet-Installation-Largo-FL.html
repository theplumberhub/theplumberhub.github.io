<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this might be an indication that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and might begin leaking soon. You can examine this by filling a couple of five-gallon pails with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you most likely need a hot water heater replacement.</p>
<p>There's a good possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative results on your health. Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt disposing a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then switch on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, broken sink? No issue is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing group does the job rapidly and affordably.</p>
