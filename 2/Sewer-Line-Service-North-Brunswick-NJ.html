<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
