When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
