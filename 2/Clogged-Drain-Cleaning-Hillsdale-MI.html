<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the yard above it to become soggy. You may smell the revolting odor of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that portion of your yard. Due to the fact that the swampiness will draw in undesirable animals, the circumstance is filled with problems.

<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
