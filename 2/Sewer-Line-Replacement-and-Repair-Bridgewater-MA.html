When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
