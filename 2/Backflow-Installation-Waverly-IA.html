<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
