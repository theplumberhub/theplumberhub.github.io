<p>Galvanized metal, is simply a simpler method of saying zinc coated" and what triggers galvanized pipes to wear away is the exposure to excessive water and minerals. You might be thinking that it does not make good sense to use a pipe that responds with water as your house's main source of water transport, and you would be correct.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
