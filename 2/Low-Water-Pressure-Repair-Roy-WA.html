<h3>Water Line Repairs in Roy Washington</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
