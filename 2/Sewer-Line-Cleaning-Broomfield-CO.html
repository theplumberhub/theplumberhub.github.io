<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need.

Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly.
