<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
