For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.

Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
