<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
