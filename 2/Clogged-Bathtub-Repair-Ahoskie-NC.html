<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow.
