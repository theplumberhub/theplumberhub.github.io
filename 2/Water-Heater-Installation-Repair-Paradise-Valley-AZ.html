Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a tough task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
