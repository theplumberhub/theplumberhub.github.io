<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Plainview TX</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

You can't constantly be certain whether the house has actually had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner knew the reason for the clog A simple camera inspection could make you knowledgeable about a hidden and very costly  issue prior to the purchase.</p>
