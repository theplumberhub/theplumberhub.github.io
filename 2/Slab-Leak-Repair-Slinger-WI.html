<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public supply of water and private on-site supply of water and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of security for the public supply of water system.</p>

They install plumbing fixtures, such as bathtubs and toilets, and devices, such as dishwashing machines and hot water heater. They clean drains, remove blockages, and repair or replace broken pipes and fixtures. Plumbers also help preserve septic systems-- big, underground holding tanks that gather waste from houses that are not connected to a sewer system.</p>
