Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
