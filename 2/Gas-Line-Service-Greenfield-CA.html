Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are among the most common signs that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, especially if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention.
