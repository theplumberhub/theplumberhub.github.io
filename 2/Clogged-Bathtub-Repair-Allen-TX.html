<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Allen TX</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>
