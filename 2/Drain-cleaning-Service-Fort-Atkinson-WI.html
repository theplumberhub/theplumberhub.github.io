<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might very well belong to your task requirements. Some water heater problems are minor enough to be successfully attended to with professional repairs. Things like an unlit pilot light, tripped circuit breaker, broken burner, or sediment buildup are all easy and relatively inexpensive to attend to. However, specific issues with your hot water heater might indicate that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can help you figure out which strategy is best for you.</p>
<p>Water could be dripping onto the pilot burner flame. A leaking tank is a reason to call a water heater professional immediately. If you consistently have backups make sure you have drain cleanouts to access your drain line rapidly.  A drain professional can use a rooter machine to clear the clog However, this does not clean the drain or prevent more backups.</p>

<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
