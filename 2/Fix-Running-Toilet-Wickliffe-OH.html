Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
