<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great man. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>Numerous property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their filthy or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to use and low-cost, however they harm your pipes and their results are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating vulnerable points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
