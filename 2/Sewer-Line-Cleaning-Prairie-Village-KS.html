<p>Household operated and owned since 2003, RT Plumbing Services delivers industry-leading plumbing competence, house renovating service, and hot water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX community. Before installing, your professional will switch off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue.
