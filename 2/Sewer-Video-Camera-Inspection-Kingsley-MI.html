<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about safeguarding people's lives and to a lower extent their property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source readily available to achieve that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result suggest that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high danger protection level.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-term connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
