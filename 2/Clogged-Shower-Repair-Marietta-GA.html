<p>Gas is a crucial energy we use every day to keep our homes and workplaces warm, our showers hot, and to prepare our food. With the day-to-day usage of gas, it is easy to understand it is reasonable that in time a leak is bound to take place.

Remember to take preventative measures when handling gas home appliances, utilize the previously mentioned indications to determine potential leaks, and call a plumber to have your gas lines regularly checked and kept.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
