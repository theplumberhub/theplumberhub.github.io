Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
