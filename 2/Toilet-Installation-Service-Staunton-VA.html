How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to initially get the needed license( s) for the work you intend to do. You can check out our License page to learn more on acquiring an authorization. When you obtain an authorization you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you need to require inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>

If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
