Repetitive usage might suggest you experience problems.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure.

The demand upstream could trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>

<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a private water supply surpasses the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause typical circulation to reverse.
