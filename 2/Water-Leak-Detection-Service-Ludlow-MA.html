<p>Irrigation backflow devices are developed for installation on safe and clean water lines to protect against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of contaminated water into the safe and clean water system. Having access to hot, clean water is important to being comfortable and safe in the house, and if your hot water heater quits working it is considered an emergency. Without hot water you can't bathe, clean your dishes, or clothes. At Total Convenience, our specialists are always available to supply instant professional water heater repair and water heater installation whenever you need it.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a possible problem with the water heater. It can also indicate the hot water heater is near completion of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old. With heavy rust accumulation on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could suggest that there have actually been changes in pressure triggering little leakages.</p>

During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
