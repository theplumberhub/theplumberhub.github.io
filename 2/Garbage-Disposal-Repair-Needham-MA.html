<p>The program achieves its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of ideal guidelines and policies for the building and construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It might be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up correctly. A water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire.

Fixing a leak and identifying can avoid damage and costly repairs. You may discover that your water pipes are leaking or you have low water pressure if you have old piping in your home.

When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
