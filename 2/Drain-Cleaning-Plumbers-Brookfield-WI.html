<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a quote as soon as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that could be possibly damaged. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
