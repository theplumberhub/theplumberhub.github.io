<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit comes in two basic types - continuous feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in place to run the unit. Continuous feed is common and the easiest to utilize; a batch feed design is more secure but can be slower to use on big amounts of food waste due to the fact that you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company supplies an introduction of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
