<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
