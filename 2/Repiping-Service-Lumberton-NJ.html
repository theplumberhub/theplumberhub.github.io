<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to supply some sort of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's wise to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
