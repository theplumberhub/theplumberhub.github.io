<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are included into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking. Ensure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
