<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to first get the required permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our License page to learn more on getting an authorization. When you get a license you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you should call for inspection prior to you conceal any work or cover.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the public utility contains some amounts of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems get rid of these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional expenditures. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, finished with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>You can relax and use your gas piping without any worry when we handle your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Inspect avoids backflow caused by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing.
