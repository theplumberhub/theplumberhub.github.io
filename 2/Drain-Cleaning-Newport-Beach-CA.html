<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and elaborate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
