<p>Irreversible magnetic water conditioning devices have been marketed based on a range of claims regarding their result on water solidity and related scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment industry, has not had the ability to figure out requirements for these items and report inconsistent efficiency to date. Research has shown no change occurs in the chemical and physical homes or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the devices (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Job Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
