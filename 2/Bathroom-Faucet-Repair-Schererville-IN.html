<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will establish.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
