It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should also be supplied.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve money. While this may work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the very same product as other pipes in your house, implying that trouble might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system.

It is important that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
