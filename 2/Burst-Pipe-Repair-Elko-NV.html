<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the service with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>The most common approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, typically salt.
