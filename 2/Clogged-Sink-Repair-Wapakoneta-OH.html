<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
