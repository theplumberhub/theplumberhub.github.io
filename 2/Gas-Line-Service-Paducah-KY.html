<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>

When this occurs you need a plumbing company that can get there fast. Recognize the full magnitude of the problem, and fix it quick.</p>
