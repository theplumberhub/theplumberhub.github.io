<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
