<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Alden NY</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
