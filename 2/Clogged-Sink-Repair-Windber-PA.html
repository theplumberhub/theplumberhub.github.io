<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
