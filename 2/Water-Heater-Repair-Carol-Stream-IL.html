<p>If you need a water softener is an individual preference, figuring out. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
