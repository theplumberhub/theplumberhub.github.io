<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).
