<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains.

<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be fixed by changing that section of harmed piping. Nevertheless, when the problem is discovered in pipes throughout your house, it might be time to think about whole-house repiping. Few property owners are thrilled with the idea of replacing all their pipes, however handling the job prior to the plumbing system stops working enables you to avoid substantial residential or commercial property damage.</p>
