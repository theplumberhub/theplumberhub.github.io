<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
