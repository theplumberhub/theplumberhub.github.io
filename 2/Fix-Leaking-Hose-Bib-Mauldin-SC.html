<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>

Other great choices are overload protection, which switches off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal.
