<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
