<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are added into gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Ensure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
