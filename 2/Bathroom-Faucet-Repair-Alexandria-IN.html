<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
