<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
