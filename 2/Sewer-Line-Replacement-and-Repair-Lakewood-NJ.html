<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for many building contractors (or their employees). The secret to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore removing firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing.

<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
