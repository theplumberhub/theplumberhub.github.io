<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there ought to be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you should most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
