It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
