<p>Are you thinking about adding a brand-new waste disposal unit to your kitchen sink? Or maybe you accidently dropped a spoon and your garbage disposal requires repair? Or possibly you just wish to replace or update a worn-out noisy garbage disposal? Whatever your situation is, we can help. Our highly trained service technicians can assess your needs, educate you on the alternatives available and offer you with a quote to offer our waste disposal unit installation and repair services.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
