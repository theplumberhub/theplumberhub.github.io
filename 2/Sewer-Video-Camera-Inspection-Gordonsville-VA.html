<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Gordonsville VA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very unusual cases where the building is considered to not posture a threat to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
