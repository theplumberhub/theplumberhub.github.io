<p>Surface Accelerated Condensation is an invention that imitates biomineralization, the mechanism typically recognized for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by utilizing proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely get rid of temporary firmness in water.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
