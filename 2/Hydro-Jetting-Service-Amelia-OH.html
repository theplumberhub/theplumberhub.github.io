Which is why choosing a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is very essential. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat suffices for security and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem.
