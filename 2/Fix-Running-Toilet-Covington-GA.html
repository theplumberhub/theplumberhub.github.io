<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
