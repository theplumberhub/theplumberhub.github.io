The factors for this can range from leaks, malfunctioning or defective electrical circuitry, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the pointed out problems, a repair or replacement of the parts may be sufficient. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place often, then a water heater replacement is required.</p>
