Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and stable  location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait till after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should likewise check to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
