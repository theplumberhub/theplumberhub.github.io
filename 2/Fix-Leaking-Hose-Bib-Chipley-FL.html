<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
