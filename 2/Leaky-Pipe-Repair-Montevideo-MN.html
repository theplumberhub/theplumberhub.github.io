<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Services in Montevideo</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex clinical process, but easy to treat. It uses salt to get rid of minerals and odors found in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and draw in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press difficult water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
