<p>You rely on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to get rid of. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are among the most common signs that your system is at the end of its life-span, specifically if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
