<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need.

It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

Which's where the term solidity" came from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
