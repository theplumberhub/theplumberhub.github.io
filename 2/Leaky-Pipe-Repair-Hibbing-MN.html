<p>Inspect the house's warm water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be greater.</p>
<p>Cost of associated products and products usually needed to install garbage disposal including: connectors, fittings and installing hardware. You can save money.
