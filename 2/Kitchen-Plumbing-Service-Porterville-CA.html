The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
