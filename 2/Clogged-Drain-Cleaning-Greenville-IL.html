<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
