Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
