The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or discolored water, it usually represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop with time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure.
