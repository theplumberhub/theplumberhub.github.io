<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Poplar Grove IL</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
