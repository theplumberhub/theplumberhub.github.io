<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Service in Fort Irwin</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
