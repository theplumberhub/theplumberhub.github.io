<p>Nevertheless, UPC design code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping products to accomplish the exact same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire security system provided by a potable water supply, increased security is also needed.

Holding on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
