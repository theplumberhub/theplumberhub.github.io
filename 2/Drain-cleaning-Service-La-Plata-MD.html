Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply years of protection. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, temperature or quality can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance.
