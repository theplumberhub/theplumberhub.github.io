If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was constructed years prior to that, possibilities are that your house may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimal rates.</p>

Many water looks alike - nevertheless inside a clear glass of water there thousands of liquified minerals which are entirely undetectable to your naked eye. One glass of faucet water can have a high material of minerals - another glass of tap water can have a low material of minerals.</p>
