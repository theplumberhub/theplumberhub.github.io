<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your home, this is one of the main and first concerns that you should ask yourself. The age of your house is an important part to understand whether you need to repipe your home. This is not just because your plumbing has aged with time, but likewise since houses that were constructed prior to a certain time period are more likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is obsolete on the planet of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your house was developed before the 1970s, we highly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was constructed years before that, possibilities are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates.</p>

This does not consist of the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.
