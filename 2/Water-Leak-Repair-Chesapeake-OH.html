<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
