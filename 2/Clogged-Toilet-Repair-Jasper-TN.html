<p>Shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel before your start loosening up any pipes or supply lines if you have a garbage disposal. Whole-house repiping can certainly be a large endeavor, which is why the service is just performed when absolutely required. First, your plumber will decide which piping material to utilize for the job, either copper or plastic. Replacing and installing new pipes can take anywhere in between 3-5 days depending on the size of your house.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

In drinkable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographical areas with corrosive water contaminants.</p>
