<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and obligation are incredibly essential to constructing a reputation for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the safe and clean supply of water within a structure these gadgets are called isolation" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.
