<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
