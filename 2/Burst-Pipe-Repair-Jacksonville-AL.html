<p>A second part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature level to see if hardness had an influence on cleaning agent savings. The study included tests that removed difficult soils, in addition to examining spotting and shooting.

That detergent cost savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more considerable costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for residents. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
