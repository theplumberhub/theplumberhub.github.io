<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can occur over time from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates inside of pipes. As a clog ends up being larger gradually, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes effectively.

<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain due to the fact that they typically consist of grease and fat.
