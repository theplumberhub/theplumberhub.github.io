A toilet's tank is composed of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular usage. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye.

Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
