<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now. Prior to you can ask for an inspection, you should initially obtain the required authorization( s) for the work you plan to do.

<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

He likewise did the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was more economical than I prepared for. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
