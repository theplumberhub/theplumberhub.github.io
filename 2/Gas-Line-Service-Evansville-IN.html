<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the major offenders. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls also. Even tree roots can develop severe drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the problem for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is taking place to your home.</p>
