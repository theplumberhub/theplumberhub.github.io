It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
