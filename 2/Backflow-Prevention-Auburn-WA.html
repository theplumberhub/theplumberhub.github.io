<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
