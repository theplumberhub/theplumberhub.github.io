<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
