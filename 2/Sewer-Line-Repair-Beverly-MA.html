<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
