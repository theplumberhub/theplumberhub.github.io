Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
