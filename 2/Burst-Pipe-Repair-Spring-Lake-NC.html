Also, the BPA should be installed according to the most current plumbing code adopted by the City of Austin.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>
