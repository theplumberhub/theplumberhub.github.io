Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>If it gradually drains away as you work, add more hot water. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to try a brand-new method. Tankless systems connect directly to your plumbing and just heat the water as it is needed. This results in cost savings on your energy bill.
