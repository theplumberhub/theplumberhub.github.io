<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and personal on-site water system and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between potable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of protection for the public water system system.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
