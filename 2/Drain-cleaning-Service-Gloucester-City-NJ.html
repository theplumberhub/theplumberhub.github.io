<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
