Our energy expenses are much lower then in the past, the air flow is virtually unnoticeable, the air temp inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular impurities that locals are dealing with and an RO can help ease those concerns. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be remedied with the best RO system.</p>
