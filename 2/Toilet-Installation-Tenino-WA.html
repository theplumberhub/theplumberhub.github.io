<p>One typical method for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private houses, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and contaminating the general public water system.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer accreditation courses created to train specialists to evaluate backflow preventers.
