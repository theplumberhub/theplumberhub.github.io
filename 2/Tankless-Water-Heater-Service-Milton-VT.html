<p>Typically brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and inspect if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Additionally, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate intermittently, as well. Water won't drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
