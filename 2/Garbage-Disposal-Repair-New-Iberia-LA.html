The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't an excellent concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight equally and could ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
