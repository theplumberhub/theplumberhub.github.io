The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
