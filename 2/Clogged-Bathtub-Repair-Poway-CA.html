<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Poway CA</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
