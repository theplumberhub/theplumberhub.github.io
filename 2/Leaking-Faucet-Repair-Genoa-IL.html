These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually restore after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
