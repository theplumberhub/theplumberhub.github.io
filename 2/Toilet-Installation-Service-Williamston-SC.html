Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
