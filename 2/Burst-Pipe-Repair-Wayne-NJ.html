<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
