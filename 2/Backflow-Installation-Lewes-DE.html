You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.

We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
