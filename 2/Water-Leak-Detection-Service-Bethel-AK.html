<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>In terms of the equipment that will be examined, there are 2 possible alternatives: a lowered pressure principle device or double check valves. Both consist of a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were great at repairing the clogged drain, but really extremely sloppy about fixing the chip in the sink and making use of puddy under the sink.</p>
