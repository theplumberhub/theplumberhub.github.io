Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
