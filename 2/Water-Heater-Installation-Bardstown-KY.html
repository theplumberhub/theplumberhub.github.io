<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indicator of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a relentless sewage smell in your house, it is important that you call a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely dangerous and can position serious health threats.</p>
<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can occur over time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up inside of pipes. As a clog becomes bigger in time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately. You can combat difficult water in different methods, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (salt carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not currently have one. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be fixed by changing that area of damaged piping.

Few homeowners are delighted with the concept of changing all their pipes, however dealing with the job before the plumbing system fails allows you to avoid considerable property damage.</p>
