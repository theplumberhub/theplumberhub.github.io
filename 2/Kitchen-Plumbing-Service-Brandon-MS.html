Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water supply within a structure these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
