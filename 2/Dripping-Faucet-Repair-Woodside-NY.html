<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less crucial things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>

That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections make certain you understand every potential gas line problem, and our repairs make sure your system is working perfectly again.</p>
