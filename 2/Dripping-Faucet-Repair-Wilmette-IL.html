The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
