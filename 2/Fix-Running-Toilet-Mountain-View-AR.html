If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak.
