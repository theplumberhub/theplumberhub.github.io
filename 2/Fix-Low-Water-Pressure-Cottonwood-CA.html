<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
