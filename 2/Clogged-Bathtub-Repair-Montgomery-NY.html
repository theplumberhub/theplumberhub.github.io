<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber might use one or a mix of piping material throughout your home repiping project. Copper is basic since it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather. Nevertheless, copper is hard to install, which means greater labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which suggests plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which saves money and time and decreases the danger of joint leaks. PEX likewise withstands deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which product is best depending upon your requirements.</p>
