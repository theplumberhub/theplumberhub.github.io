You should wait up until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
