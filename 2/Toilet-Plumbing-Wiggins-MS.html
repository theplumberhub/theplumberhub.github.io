<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and stable  place.
