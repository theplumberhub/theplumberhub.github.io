<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

<p>In the kitchen, you may have a farmhouse or apron sink, a bar sink, an undermount sink, or a cast iron sink, perhaps with an enamel plating.
