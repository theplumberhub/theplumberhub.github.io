<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
