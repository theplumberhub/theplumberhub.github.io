<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
