<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for a lot of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
