<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to perform website inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a possible or actual cross-connection risk on a customer's plumbing system.
