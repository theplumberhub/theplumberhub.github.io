<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. When shopping for a new flapper, your best option is to try and find the same flapper that initially included your existing flush valve.

If you do not understand your design number, however, we do use a comprehensive selection of "will fit" flappers to help you out. Watch the video below to get more information about the different type of flappers available, or visit How To Replace Toilet Flappers for short tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
