Another tip to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils.

<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and offered for usage. Likewise, rust of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion, request that a new one be installed.</p>
<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we may utilize a range of various techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated form of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire adapters. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp adapter and eliminate wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
