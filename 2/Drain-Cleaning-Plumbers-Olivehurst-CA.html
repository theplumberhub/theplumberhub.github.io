<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
