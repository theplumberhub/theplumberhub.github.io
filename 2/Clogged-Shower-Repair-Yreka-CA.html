Oftentimes it's more useful to hire a professional plumber in Utah.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly need to be tested to determine what is in need of repair. The field test might not constantly reveal you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair kit are required.

It will be better to live with a brand-new, more effective system than to invest in regular repairs.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
