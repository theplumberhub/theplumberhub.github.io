<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation of water which may bring dirty water or other, dangerous compounds into the general public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can occur in a variety of circumstances that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines.

One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>There are particular plumbers who specialize in plumbing connected with home remodeling and brand-new building. When a brand-new home is constructed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber might be a fantastic prospect for unclogging your toilet, a more customized plumber needs to be used for home remodeling work.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
