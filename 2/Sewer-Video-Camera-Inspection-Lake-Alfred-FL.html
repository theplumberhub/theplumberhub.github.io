<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Lake Alfred FL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
