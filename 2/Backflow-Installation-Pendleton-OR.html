<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Backpressure may occur when the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping.

If these connections are not appropriately safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
