<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
