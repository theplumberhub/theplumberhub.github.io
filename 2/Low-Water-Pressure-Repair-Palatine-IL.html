<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
