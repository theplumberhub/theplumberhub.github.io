<p>If you discover yourself constantly wiggling the flush lever to attempt to stop your toilet from running, it's time to hire one of our licensed Columbus plumbers to assist you in discovering the leak or broken element and repairing it. Grease: Never ever pour grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than removing, these materials often congeal to form nasty obstructions, which you may need a plumber to remove.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still occur.</p>
