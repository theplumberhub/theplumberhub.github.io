<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
