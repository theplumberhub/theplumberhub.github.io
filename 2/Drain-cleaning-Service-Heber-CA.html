There are 2 main type of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and minimized pressure zone assembly (RPZ) gadgets are most commonly used in commercial centers.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. If your toilet is reasonably new, you may need to change toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain.

Check the list of state licensing companies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
