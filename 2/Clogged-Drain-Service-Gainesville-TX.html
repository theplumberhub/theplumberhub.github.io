<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative.

<p>There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes likewise result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Some softeners deal with electricity, but some more recent water softeners use waterpower.
