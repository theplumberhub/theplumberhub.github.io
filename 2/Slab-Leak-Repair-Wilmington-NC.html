<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
