Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
