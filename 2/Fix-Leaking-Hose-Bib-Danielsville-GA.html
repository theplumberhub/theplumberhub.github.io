<p>As soon as the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
