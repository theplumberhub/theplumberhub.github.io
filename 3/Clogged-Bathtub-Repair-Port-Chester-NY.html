Prior to setting up, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is connected to its install.

A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
