<p>Although it may be appealing to gather non-prescription drain-clearing products, many plumbers recommend against it. Not just are the chemicals toxic if exposed to human skin, they may also harm drain pipes if overused. There are additional issues that may show up, which is why our experienced plumbers will perform a thorough inspection of your system to determine what has actually caused it to breakdown.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
