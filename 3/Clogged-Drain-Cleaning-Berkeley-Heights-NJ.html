Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
