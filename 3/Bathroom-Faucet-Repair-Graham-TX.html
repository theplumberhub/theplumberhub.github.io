<p>Due to the fact that it can spread out contaminated water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a possible problem in a water system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or potential connection between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable toxins or pollutants to go into the safe and clean water system.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
