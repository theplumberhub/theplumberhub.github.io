<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
