<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. You must wait till after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
