<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing.

<p>Tankless Hot water heater - supply hot water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is warmed as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger.
