<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
