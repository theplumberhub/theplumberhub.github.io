<p>In addition to supplying prompt, effective water heater repair services, our skilled plumbing professionals at Big Blue Plumbing in Alameda, CA, provide full hot water heater installation. Sometimes a repair just will not look after the problem you're experiencing, while other times the expense of the repair isn't worth paying out on an old hot water heater. Whatever the reason, there are times when purchasing a brand-new hot water heater becomes the needed choice.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a residence is due to the fact that there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite cheap and simple to install, so there's no factor not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and avoids water circulation, eventually triggering a backup. This included with other particles in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
