<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line brings wastewater far from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your house. A broken gas line is a really serious concern, and in some cases a problem will emerge at the most bothersome times.

<p>Rusting and rust on the exterior of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a possible concern with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also mean the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy rust accumulation on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could suggest that there have been variations in pressure triggering small leaks.</p>
