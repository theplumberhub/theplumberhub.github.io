The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regenerate after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
