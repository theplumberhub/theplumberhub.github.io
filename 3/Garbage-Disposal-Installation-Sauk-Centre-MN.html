I picked this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>

<p>If you see low water pressure or discolored water, it generally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up over time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure.

<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working successfully because hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use a growing number of detergent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution.
