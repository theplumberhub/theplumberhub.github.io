<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes.

The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
