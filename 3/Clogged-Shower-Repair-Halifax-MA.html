<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>If the pipes that need to be repaired run below landscaping or underneath your home or building. Hydro jetting uses innovative technology to send out a strong stream of water through your pipes to search the interiors and eliminate stubborn clogs. In some cases we use an unique camera prior to hydro jetting to target the specific problems inside your pipes.</p>
