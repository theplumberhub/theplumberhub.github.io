<p>Quality sinks appropriately installed last for decades, so we're normally contacted for kitchen and bath remodels. However with stains or scratches in a kitchen sink as well as cracked or split porcelain in bathroom sinks lots of house owners choose a sink installation alone.

<p>Do not use ground joint unions other than directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each location where you will have a gas appliance need to have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, any person who sets up gas piping on property not under their ownership need to have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need an authorization and inspection.</p>
