<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Freedom CA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Depending on the degree of the clog, we might utilize a variety of various techniques, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative form of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and get rid of wire ports. Detach garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp port and remove wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
