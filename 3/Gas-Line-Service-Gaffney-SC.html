<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that certain magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be effective in avoiding scale formation in hard water systems. It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well adequate described to allow others to examine them and to verify the outcomes.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
