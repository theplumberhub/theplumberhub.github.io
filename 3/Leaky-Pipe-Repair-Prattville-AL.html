The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, a lot of drain concerns can only be discovered once they start to back up. However, during routing plumbing inspections, a full test of all drains will be performed.

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more reliable at eliminating obstructions. Lots of homes have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older homes without cleanouts.
