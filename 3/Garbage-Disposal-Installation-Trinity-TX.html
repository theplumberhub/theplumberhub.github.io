<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair professional knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
