<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
