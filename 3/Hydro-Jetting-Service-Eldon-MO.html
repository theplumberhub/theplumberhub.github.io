Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
