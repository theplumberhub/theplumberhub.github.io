Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger blockages and jams - consider composting or placing these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain too. After ending up cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or easily location in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
