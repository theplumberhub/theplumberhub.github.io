<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>
