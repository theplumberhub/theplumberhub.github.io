<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas device need to have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who installs gas piping on residential or commercial property not under their ownership need to possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups need an authorization and inspection.</p>
