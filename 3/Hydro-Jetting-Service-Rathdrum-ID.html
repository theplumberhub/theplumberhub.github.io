When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Electrical Breakdowns: Modern hot water heater also count on electrical components. If something inside the unit stops working, you might be entrusted no hot water The discharge line is pressurized and can run some distance. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain? Even a kitchen or bathroom sink drain will make much better connection than running exterior.</p>
