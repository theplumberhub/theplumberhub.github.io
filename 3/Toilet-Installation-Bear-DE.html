There may be extra test treatments, beyond those developed in the tester accreditation program, that can supply data showing the seriousness of the failure that might help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
