As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
