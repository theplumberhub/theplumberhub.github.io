<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Tenino WA</h3>
<p>The most effective method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
