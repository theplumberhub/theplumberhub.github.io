<p>Sinks aren't as easy as they utilized to be. Nowadays, house owners can choose from a dizzying range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink.
