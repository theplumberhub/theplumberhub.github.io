<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is easy and low-cost. But discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently offered in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
