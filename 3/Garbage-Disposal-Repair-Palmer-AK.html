<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that it can spread out infected water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a prospective problem in a water system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or actual connection between the public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or contaminants to enter the safe and clean water supply. Sickness can result from ingesting water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
