<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be much more destructive than helpful, potentially gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, including both supply of water and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe deserves the investment in the long run since it may resolve the root cause of the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>
