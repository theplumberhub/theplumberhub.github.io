Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide.

If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
