<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician shut off the water supply and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to eliminate the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
