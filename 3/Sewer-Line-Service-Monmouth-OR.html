<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Everyday usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You need to also check to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
