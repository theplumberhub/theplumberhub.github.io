<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically carried somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be prone to blocking since there simply isn't enough a high adequate flow to flush out the particles.</p>

<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll.
