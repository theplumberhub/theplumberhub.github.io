<p>The most reliable way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Soft water is readily available 24 hr a day, seven days a week, even during regrowth. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, worn out flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve.
