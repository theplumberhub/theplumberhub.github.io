It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to fully clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a constant clogging issue.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out annual forward flow tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
