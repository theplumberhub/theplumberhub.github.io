<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Mount Orab OH</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>
