<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
