<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This deterioration can result in a buildup of lead, which can have lots of negative results on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to go on and replace the entire line. If the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout, definitely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate choice to do simply that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be an alternative.</p>
