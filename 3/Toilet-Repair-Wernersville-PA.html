<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Copper is the industry standard because it is long enduring and long lasting.

The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
