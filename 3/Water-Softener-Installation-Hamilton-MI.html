<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective impurities can then enter the potable water supply. The best method to lower build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
