<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
