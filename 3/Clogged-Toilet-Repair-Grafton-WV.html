<p>Utilize the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. Numerous houses in my community being repiped and have actually talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger significant damage if the leak isn't spotted soon.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
