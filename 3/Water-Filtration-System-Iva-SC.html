<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Iva SC 29655</h3>
<p>If you find yourself continuously wiggling the flush lever to attempt to stop your toilet from running, it's time to call in among our licensed Columbus plumbers to help you in discovering the leak or broken part and fixing it. Grease: Never put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Instead of getting rid of, these materials often harden to form nasty blockages, which you may need a plumber to eliminate.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
