<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
