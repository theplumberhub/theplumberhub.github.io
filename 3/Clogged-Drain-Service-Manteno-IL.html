<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
