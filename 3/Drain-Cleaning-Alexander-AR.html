<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

Some electrical understanding is required to make sure the wires are disconnected properly. Response: No! They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
