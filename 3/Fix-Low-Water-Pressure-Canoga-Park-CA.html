<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, identifying. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
