<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
