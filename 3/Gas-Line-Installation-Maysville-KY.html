<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the significant offenders. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce severe drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for normal home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
