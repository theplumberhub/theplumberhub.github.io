<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
