<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it.

Parts involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Incorrectly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, ought to be reconfigured.</p>
