<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Olive Branch MS</h3>

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
