<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line.
