<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Yreka CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
