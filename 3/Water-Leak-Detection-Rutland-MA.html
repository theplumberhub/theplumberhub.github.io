Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
