<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It's important to see what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause jams and blockages - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and harden in your drain as well. After ending up cooking, think about putting remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
