The water is constantly warmed as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated if the tap is immediately switched off.

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position.
