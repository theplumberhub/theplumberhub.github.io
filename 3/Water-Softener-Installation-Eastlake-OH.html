<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
