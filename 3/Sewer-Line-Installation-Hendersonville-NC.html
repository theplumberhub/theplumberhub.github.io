<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow.
