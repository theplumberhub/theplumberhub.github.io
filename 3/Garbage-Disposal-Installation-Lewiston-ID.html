Water conditioners are gadgets that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to use salt.
