<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place television back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short.

Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
