While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
