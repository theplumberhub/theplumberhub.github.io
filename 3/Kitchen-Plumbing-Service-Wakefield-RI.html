<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
