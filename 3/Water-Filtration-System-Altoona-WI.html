<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
