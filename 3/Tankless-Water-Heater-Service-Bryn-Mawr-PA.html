<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
