<p>Backpressure may occur when the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not appropriately safeguarded.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Many house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their dirty or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are simple to use and low-cost, but they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly suggested.</p>
