<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Athens TX 75751</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than products consisting of severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
