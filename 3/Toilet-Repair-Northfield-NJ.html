The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
