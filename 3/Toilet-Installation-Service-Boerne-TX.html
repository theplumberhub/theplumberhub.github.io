<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
