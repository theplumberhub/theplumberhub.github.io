<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Belmont NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
