<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply.

Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
