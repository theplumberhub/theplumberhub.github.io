<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Breathing in leaked gas in an indoor area, such as your home can result in a lack of oxygen in the air and result in hypoxia.

That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener.
