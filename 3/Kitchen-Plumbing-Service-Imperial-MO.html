Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
