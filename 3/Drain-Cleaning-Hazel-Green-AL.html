<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Pieces that consist of kitchen sink drains can become used and corroded, resulting in leakages.

Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, ought to be reconfigured.</p>
