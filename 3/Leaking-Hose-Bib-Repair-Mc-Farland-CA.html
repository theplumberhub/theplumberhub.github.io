<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
