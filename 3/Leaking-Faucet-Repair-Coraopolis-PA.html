<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
