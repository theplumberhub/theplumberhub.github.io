<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
