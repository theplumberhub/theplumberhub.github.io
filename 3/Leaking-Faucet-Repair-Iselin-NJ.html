<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process.

At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
