Sufficient drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
