They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
