<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and private on-site supply of water and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
