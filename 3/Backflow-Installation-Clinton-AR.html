Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system.

Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
