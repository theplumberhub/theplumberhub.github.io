<p>Water system by the water company contains some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are necessary requirements, not optional expenditures.

<p>Although it may be appealing to pour in over the counter drain-clearing items, many plumbers encourage against it. Not just are the chemicals hazardous if exposed to human skin, they might also harm drain pipes if overused. There are additional problems that might show up, which is why our knowledgeable plumbers will carry out an extensive inspection of your system to determine what has triggered it to breakdown. From there we can make an informed choice on whether your issue can be resolved by an easy repair or if replacing the waste disposal unit is eventually the much better alternative.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
