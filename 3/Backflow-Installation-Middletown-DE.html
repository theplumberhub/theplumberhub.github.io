<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. If the water turns off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed properly (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
