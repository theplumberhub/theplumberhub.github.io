<p>Hydro jetting is among lots of trenchless services offered to you, available via North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, highly pressurized water through a protected hose and nozzle to clear any and all obstructions.

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
