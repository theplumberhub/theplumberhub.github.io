<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
