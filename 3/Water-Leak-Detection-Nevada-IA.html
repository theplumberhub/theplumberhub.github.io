<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is an innovation that imitates biomineralization, the mechanism commonly acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally remove momentary firmness in water.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for performing yearly forward flow tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to just connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
<p>One typical way for a home's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread out greatly. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the general public water supply.</p>
