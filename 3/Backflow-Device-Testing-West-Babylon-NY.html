<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is utilized to express the strength of the level of acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will potentially add to the development of carbonic acid, thus making the water more corrosive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
