<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would typically cause rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually end up being worn and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your water heater really quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Many homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or filthy drain problems. These chemicals are easy to use and low-cost, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize extreme chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating vulnerable points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always suggested.</p>
<p>Low pH likewise increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to express the strength of the acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating rust Co2 will potentially contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, thus making the water more corrosive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
