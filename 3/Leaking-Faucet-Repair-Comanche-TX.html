Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
