It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair service technician knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.
