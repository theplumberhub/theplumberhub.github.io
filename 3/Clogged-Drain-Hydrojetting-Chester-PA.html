<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable option, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
