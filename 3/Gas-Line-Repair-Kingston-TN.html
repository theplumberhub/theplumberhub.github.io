<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
