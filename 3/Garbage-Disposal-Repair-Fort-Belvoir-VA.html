<p>In this circumstance, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual flow, taste, odor or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature level or pressure may require changing the water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you include a water softener, it removes the mineral content to produce odorless drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
