Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk defense assembly.</p>
