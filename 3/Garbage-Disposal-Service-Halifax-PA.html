A standard by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
