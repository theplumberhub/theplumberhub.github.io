As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and cracks. The liner is left to harden in location for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used.

It is necessary that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
