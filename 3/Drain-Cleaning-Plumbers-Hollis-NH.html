<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical option, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>
