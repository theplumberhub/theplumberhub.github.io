<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Arlington WA 98223</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
