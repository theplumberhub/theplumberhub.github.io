<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
