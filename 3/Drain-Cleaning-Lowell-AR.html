<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>

<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
