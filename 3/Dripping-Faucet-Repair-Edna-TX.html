<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
