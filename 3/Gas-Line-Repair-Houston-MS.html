<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
