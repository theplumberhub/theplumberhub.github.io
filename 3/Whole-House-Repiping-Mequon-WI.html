The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.

When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
