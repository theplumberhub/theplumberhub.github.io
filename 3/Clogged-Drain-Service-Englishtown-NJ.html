<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is essential to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause jams and blockages - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can collect and cake in your drain too. After finishing cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Englishtown NJ</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
