The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result.

Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
