<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Galveston TX 77550</h3>

Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation of water which might carry unclean water or other, dangerous compounds into the public water system and private plumbing.
