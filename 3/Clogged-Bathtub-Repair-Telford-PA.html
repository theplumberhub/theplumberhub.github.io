<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are particular impurities that locals are handling and an RO can help minimize those concerns. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be corrected with the ideal RO system.</p>
