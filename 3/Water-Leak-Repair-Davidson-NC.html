<p>Backpressure may happen when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are some of the most crucial functions of a business. If toilets and urinals don't operate effectively, consumers can leave your business with a negative impression.
