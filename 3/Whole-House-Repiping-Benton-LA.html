<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

Look for leakages and tighten up as required. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as preferred.</p>
