<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for performing yearly forward circulation tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be repaired by replacing that area of damaged piping. Nevertheless, when the problem is discovered in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to consider whole-house repiping. Few homeowners are delighted with the concept of changing all their pipes, but managing the job prior to the plumbing system fails allows you to avoid significant property damage.</p>
