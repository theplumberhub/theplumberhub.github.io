<p>Since it can spread infected water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a possible problem in a water system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or potential connection in between the public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow impurities or toxins to get in the safe and clean water supply. Sickness can result from ingesting water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's concealed; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims.
