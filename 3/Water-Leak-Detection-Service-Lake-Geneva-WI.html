<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Lake Geneva WI</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Drains clog for a reason, however it's not always apparent. It is highly suggested that a professional plumber perform a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has actually clogged. This is doubly important if you're buying a house. Imagine in the above circumstance understanding the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a home. You can't always be particular whether the home has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous property owner knew the reason for the clog An easy camera inspection could make you familiar with a concealed and extremely costly  issue prior to the purchase.</p>
