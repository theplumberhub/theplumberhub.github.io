<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>One of the important things we concentrate on is the bathroom toilet. Numerous individuals and businesses let the toilet drainage year after year with leaking or inefficient models. This is cash and a natural deposit running down the drain. Water conservation in the desert is necessary and older toilets can utilize 3.5 gallons of water per flush! Our master professionals will have the ability to bring back or replace the toilet the same day in many cases saving you money and time.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt dumping a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then switch on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn out sink? No issue is undue for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing group does the job quickly and cost effectively.</p>
