<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
