<p>By itself, natural gas is colorless and odorless. Most utility companies include a sulfur compound to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from. That method, you can easily tell if you have a gas leak.

<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Dubuque IA</h3>
<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit can be found in two basic types - continuous feed, which normally has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to run the system. Constant feed prevails and the easiest to utilize; a batch feed design is more secure but can be slower to utilize on large amounts of food waste because you have to process it in batches.
