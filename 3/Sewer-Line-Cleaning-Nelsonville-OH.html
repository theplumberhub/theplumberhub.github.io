<h3>Faucet Replacement in Nelsonville Ohio</h2>

Blanc likewise constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
