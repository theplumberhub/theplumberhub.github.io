<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age.

Also, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. Request that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of rust.</p>
