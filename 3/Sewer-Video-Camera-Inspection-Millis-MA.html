<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe location.
