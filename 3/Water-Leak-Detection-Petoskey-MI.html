<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To preserve your house, health, and security convenience, we use only the best piping: polyethylene. Lots of houses and organisations use galvanized pipes for water flow, which tend to degrade and can negatively affect our health. Copper is likewise typically used because of its longevity and much safer construction, but polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the marketplace and ensures the healthiest and cleanest water flow.</p>

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Call 800-483-0784 to ask for service if you need aid with your plumbing pipes.

<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.
