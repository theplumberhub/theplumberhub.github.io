<p>Checking the water, condition, and age lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers comprehend many things, including water pressure and indications of leakages.

<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system offering the make-up water. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible impurities can then go into the drinkable water system. The best way to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year.
