<p>Irrigation backflow devices are designed for installation on safe and clean water lines to safeguard against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the drinkable water system.

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
