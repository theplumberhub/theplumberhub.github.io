<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see however rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
