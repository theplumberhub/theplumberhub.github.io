It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water.

Sufficient drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
