<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program safeguards the public supply of water from toxins and impurities that could, under particular scenarios, be drawn into the public supply of water from private properties.

Toilets vary in design, flushing effectiveness and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more expensive than others. When setting up a new toilet, the plumber might also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>
