<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Morton MS 39117</h3>
<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with hard water, you may not realize how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Hard water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Hard water likewise makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>
