<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
