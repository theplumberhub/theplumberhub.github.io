Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this could be an indication of a larger problem, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog.
