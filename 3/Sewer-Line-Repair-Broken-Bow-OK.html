<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
