<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and rust. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized.
