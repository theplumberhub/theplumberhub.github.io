<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Current Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up throughout the designated period. They disconnected the sinks, tidied up and advised a tool to be used in the future. How do you understand if it's time to call for sewer line repair or replacement? Watch out for multiple clogged drains in your home, overruning or backed up toilets, or water discolorations on your walls and structure.</p>
