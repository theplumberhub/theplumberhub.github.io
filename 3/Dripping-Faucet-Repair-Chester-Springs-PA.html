<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used.

<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
