<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Lawrenceburg TN</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Toilets are difficult things to know. They've been constructed basically the same way for centuries, so you can't truly inform how old they are. It might not work very well all the time, but you can't tell if that's typical or not. Plus, there's that universal however never ever unacknowledged feeling that it's you-you're somehow doing something wrong in there.</p>
