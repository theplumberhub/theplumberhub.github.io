<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the issue.
