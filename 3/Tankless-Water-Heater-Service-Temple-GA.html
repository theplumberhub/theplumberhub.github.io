The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
