<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger substantial problems. Even little leaks can gradually moisten walls and floors till they become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may become rusty and include rust to the supply of water. Gurgling sound from pipes. A weird, gurgling noise originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a great indication. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to address this concern. Call a plumber right away.</p>
