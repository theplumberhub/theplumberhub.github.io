If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The good news is that it doesn't always need a repair of your whole system if you think your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts break, they result in tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
