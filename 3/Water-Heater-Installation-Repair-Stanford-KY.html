<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
