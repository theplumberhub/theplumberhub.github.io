The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
