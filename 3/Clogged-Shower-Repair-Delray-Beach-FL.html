<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, changing a gas or electrical water tank with a similar model takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and remove your old water heater. Positioning the brand-new unit takes roughly 30 minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the new connection points and validate that all functions depend on code.</p>
