<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
