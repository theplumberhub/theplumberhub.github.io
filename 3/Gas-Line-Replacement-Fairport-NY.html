<p>Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

<p>When making a selection, request evidence of a license. Many states need plumbers to be licensed, and they normally supply a number you can contact us to confirm that the license is current and that there are no active grievances versus it.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a severe security concern. Do not take any possibilities. Make certain the softener is set to the solidity of your water system. If the solidity is set too high, the softener will cost more to lose and operate water, costing you money.
