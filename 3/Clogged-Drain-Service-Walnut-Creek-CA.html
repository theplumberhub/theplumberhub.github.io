<h3>Hot Water Heater Problems in Walnut Creek California</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the major factor to the firmness of Woodbury's water. Firmness can look like an annoyance when water is boiled or dried from a drip since it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes. It also hinders soap and detergent usage. People with very soft water can utilize smaller amounts of soap and detergent for washing.</p>
