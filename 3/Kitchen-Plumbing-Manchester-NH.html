<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
