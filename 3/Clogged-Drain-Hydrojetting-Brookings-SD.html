<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Reduced to TAC, this approach utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where firmness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline type that will not hold on to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and flow typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regeneration.</p>
