<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than products containing extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>

If you live in an earthquake-prone region, strap the water heater to the wall with unique straps (Fig. A; available at plumbing shops and house centers). If they're required, your plumbing inspector will inform you.</p>
