<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Rotate the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

A deposit of no more than half of the job quote is typically collected beforehand and deducted from the overall task cost when it is completed.</p>
