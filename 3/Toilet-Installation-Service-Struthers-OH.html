<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to conduct website inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is needed as an outcome of a real or possible  cross-connection hazard on a client's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are only performed on Wednesdays. Area Repairs: Using one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we find with the camera inspection straight without rooting out any more than we need to.</p>
