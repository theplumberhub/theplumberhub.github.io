It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl).

Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
