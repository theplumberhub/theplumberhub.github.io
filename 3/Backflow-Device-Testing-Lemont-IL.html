<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>There are two broad classifications of sources of potential cross contamination: internal and external.

A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the building is considered to not posture a risk to the water supply, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
