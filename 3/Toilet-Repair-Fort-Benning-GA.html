<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Rusty pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
