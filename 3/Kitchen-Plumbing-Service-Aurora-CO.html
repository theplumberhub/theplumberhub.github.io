<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are badly harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
