<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to offer decades of protection. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature can all cause the assembly to weaken in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>
