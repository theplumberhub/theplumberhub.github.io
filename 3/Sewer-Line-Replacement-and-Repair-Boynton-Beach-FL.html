<h3>Leaking Pipes Repair in Boynton Beach Florida</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
