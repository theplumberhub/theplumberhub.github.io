<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing set up during building and construction of a new or renovated structure is installed by experienced craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

Obstructions in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
