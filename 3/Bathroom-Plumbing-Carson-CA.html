<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
