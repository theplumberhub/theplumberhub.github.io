<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
