<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
