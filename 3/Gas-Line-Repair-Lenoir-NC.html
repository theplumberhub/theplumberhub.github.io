<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and steady  place.
