<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
