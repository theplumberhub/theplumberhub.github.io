<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for homeowners. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist determine.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap builds up down the drain due to the fact that they generally contain grease and fat. When the fat of the soap combines with mineral water, it forms a strong residue and sticks to the pipes, obstructing them.
