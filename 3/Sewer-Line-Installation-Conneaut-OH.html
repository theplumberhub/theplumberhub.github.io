Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is a good idea. The energy performance of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Element (EF). The more efficient the water heater the higher the EF rating. Nevertheless, even if a hot water heater has a higher EF value, it does not always suggest it will have lower operating expense. You also have to consider the fuel source.</p>
