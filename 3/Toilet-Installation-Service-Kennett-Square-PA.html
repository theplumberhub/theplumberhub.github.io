<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>There are health and wellness risks one need to avoid while dealing with a sewer line task. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are discovered in sewer pipes and may expose workers during the sewer repair procedure. If your Do It Yourself dig strikes a natural gas line, breathing the gas can harm your body, and there is a threat of fire or surge damage to your residential or commercial property or your next-door neighbor's. Another risk in sewer repair projects is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too important to run the risk of in a DIY sewer job! Avoid these safety threats by employing a professional plumber.</p>
