The technicians from Charlotte Plumbing Masters can also help you out with the planning and the very best option of design for your needs.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
