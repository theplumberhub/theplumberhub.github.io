<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be a sign of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a consistent sewage smell in your home, it is important that you call a certified plumber. Raw sewage is very hazardous and can present serious health threats.</p>
