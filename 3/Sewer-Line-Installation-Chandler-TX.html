<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
