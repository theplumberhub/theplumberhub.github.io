<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Somerset PA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
