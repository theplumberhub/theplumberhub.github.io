<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to fluctuating pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve is part of the system for that specific factor. But while small drips need to not be cause for concern, homeowners ought to watch on the water heater leakages.
