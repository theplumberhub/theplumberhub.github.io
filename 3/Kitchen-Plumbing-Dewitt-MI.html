<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized during regrowth. Lastly, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
