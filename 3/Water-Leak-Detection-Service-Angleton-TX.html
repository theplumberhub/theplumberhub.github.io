Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

Homeowners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can likewise be low.</p>
