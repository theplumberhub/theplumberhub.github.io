<p>Letters are sent out to residential clients with recognized backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
