<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
