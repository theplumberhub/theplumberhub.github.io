<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
