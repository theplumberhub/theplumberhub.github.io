<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably basic system, regardless of their importance. The majority of commercial usage backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your business, where irrigation fulfills the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the motion of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This guarantees that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems stays disconnected from clean" water.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high threat security assembly.</p>
