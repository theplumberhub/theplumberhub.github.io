<p>Irreversible magnetic water conditioning devices have been marketed based upon a variety of claims regarding their effect on water hardness and associated scale development. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has not had the ability to determine requirements for these products and report irregular efficiency to date. Research study has actually shown no change occurs in the chemical and physical properties or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the devices (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Task Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no adverse results and are, in reality, essential day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the revitalizing taste many people find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the efficiency of soaps and detergents.

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Lucasville OH</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
