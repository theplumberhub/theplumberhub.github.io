<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
