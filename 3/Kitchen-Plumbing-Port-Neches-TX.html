<p>The very best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure decreasing valve (PRV).

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
