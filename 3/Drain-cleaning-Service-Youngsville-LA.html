<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
