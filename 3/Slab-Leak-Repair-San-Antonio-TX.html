<p>Remember that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you should only work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs record moisture so that it doesn't enter the control system. Although small pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Reduced to TAC, this approach utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline form that will not hold on to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regeneration.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe because the plumber will need to navigate through walls to do the job.
