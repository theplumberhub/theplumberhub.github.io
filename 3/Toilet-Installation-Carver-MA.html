<p>E.R. Services understands the value of preserving the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you see weird popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Lacking hot water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to carry out site inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is needed as an outcome of a possible or actual cross-connection danger on a customer's plumbing system.

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
