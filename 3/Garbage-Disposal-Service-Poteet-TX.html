<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of piping that are utilized in the repiping procedure. Since of their efficiency, safety and cost, copper piping and PEX piping are used.

This material is resistant against deterioration and will help improve water pressure.</p>
