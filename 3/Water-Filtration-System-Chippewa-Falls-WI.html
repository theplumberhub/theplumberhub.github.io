<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

It is really difficult to evaluate such claims, which are practically never ever based on tests that are well enough explained to enable others to examine them and to confirm the outcomes.
