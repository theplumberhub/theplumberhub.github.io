<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce serious drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for normal house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is occurring to your home.</p>
