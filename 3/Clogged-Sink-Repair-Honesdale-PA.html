<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both indoors and underground, DCVs are a bit more expensive but are also highly practical, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic tanks or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to identify correct maintenance schedules or the extent of required repairs. When the corrupt sales representative takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in extremely bad condition and state it is your pipe.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
