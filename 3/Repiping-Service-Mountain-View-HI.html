Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately protected, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
