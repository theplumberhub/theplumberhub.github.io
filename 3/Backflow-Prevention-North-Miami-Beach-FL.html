When it rains, any excess water is expected to decrease a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your residential or commercial property when it rains, then there is a good chance that the storm drain is clogged and therefore needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a prompt manner, the possibilities are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>The usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.
