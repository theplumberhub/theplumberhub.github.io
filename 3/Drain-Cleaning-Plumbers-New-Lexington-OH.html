<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you should probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
