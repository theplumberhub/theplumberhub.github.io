<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical option, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
