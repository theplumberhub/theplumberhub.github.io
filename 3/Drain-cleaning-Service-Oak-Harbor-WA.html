In truth, commercial sink drains have more parts than residential sink drains. Call the specialists at Roto-Rooter if your commercial sinks have a clogged drain.

A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to landfills and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
