Commercial sinks deal with more water and have a more reliable straining system to keep food and other particles out of the plumbing system. In truth, commercial sink drains have more parts than residential sink drains. Call the specialists at Roto-Rooter if your commercial sinks have a clogged drain.

<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to landfills and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
