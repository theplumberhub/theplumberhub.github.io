<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must initially obtain the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Authorization page to learn more on getting a permit. When you get a license you can commence with the work. However, you need to require inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Many scattering systems currently have the correct backflow preventer installed and need just be tested yearly. Others might not meet state and local guidelines and might need to be changed with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
<p>However, you also need to consider the age of your system. If your system is getting close to ten years old, it's usually not smart to pay for repairs if they deserve more than half of the rate of a brand-new unit. If problems end up being more regular with an older system, then it is encouraged that you have the waste disposal unit changed. We provide a number of affordable and extremely effective systems, and supply in advance prices prior to work begins so there are not a surprises. It is our goal to offer all of our valued clients throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding areas the service they need at a price they can manage.</p>

All gas piping installations require a permit and inspection.</p>
