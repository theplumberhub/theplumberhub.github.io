The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
