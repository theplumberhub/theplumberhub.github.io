<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>
