<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
