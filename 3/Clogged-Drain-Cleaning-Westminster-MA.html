<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
