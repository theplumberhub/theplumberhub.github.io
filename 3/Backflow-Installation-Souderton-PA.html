<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing.
