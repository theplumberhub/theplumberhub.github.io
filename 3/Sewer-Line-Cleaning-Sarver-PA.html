<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply.

Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
