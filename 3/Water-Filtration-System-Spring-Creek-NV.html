<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
