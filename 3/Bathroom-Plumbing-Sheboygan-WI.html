<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>
