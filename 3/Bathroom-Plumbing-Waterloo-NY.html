<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Generally, the cost savings have actually been based mostly on reducing chemical and cleaning agent costs. While those savings are still significant, brand-new commercial softening technology utilizing multi-tank systems (MTS) also uses significant water and salt savings.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little filling dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard security assembly.</p>

He noted that there are particular impurities that residents are handling and an RO can help reduce those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.
