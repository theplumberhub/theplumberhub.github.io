Put simply, it's a device that guarantees water circulations in one direction. When you have a sewer issue, you'll want the sewer repair process to decrease disruptions to your residential or commercial property or business. You probably do not wish to dig up your patio, parking lot or landscape.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which might bring dirty water or other, dangerous substances into the public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can take place in a number of situations that may draw water from places such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
