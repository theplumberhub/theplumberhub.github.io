<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be warmed and offered for use.
