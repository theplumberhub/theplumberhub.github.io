<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence utilized to aesthetically check the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to determine the condition of small size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
