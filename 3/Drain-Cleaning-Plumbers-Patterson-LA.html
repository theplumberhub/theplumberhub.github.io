AVB's can be plastic or brass and either manual or electrical. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are installed on each zone of the watering system, instantly after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can trigger regular flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, consisting of toilet, sink, tub and floor drains.</p>
