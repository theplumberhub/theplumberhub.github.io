<p>Numerous toilet problems, consisting of leaking toilets, do not require repairing the entire toilet. Like any house appliance, a toilet tank features lots of little moving parts that may need replaced with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
