<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is only geared up to handle softer natural waste. It could cause it to jam and not work correctly if bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. However you risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit units may cost more when they need to fit local water and sewer capabilities. The plumbing in your house should work well or backup can take place, and septic systems may need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid flatware from going into the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
