<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
