These crystals are tiny and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regeneration.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
