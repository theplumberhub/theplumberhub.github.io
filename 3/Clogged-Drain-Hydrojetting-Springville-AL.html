<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
