<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, including poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and rust. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have been permitted to freeze.</p>
