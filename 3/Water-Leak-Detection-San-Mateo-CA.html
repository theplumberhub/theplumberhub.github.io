<p>It is approximated that the average person spends over 3 years of their life sitting on the toilet, and lots of bathroom readers are at threat of becoming completely connected to the component. Which is why choosing a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally important. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet.
