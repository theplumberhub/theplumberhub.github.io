Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>

<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
