<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
