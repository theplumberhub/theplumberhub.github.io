<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Defense Prepare for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your natural gas home appliances. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals feature this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't wear out as quick.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection provides inspection services for all commercial and industrial buildings, and confirms compliance with the electrical code. The intent of electrical inspection is to make sure compliance with the applicable electrical code in order to minimize individual, and structural electrical hazards. If you presume a gas leak, first call your local energy company then call a plumber. Licensed professional plumbers will identify and repair the gas leak, offer licenses, and collaborate with the city for last inspections. An utility company will identify if there is a gas leak, however they do not locate the source of the leak or repair it.</p>
