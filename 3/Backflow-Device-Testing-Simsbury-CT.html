<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Simsbury CT</h3>
<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 fundamental types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in place to run the system.
