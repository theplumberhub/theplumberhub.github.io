It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.
