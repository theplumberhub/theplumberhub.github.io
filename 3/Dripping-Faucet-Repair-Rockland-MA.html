Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes lots of little moving parts that might need replaced with use with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can likewise occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
