<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The specialist switched off the water system and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The client helped our specialist in moving the toilet back into its proper location, and the technician tightened the bolts prior to bring back the water supply and ensuring that the toilet was properly flushing.</p>
