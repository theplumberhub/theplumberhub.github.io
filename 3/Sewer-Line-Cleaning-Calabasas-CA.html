<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
