<p>The heating aspect is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this specific concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your house. The factors for this can range from leaks, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is one of the pointed out problems, a repair or replacement of the components might be adequate. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is essential.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
