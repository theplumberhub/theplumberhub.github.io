<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
