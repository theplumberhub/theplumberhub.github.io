TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this kind of camera to identify and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly helpful in finding a problem.</p>
