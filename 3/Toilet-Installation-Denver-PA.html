<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough task because of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
