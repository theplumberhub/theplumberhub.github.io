<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are specific pollutants that homeowners are handling and an RO can help minimize those concerns. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be remedied with the best RO system.</p>
