<p>Numerous homeowners think their energy companies or property owners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that in many cases you, the homeowner, are responsible. A lot of standard property owners insurance plan and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>This warranty qualifies and represents all other guarantees to the client, whether expressed or implied. This service warranty disclaims without constraint indicated guarantees of merchantability or physical fitness for a specific purpose or treatment of specific water conditions.
