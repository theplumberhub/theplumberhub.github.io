A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly rare cases where the building is deemed to not pose a danger to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
