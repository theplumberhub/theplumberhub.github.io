<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit can be found in 2 fundamental types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to run the system. Continuous feed is common and the most convenient to use; a batch feed model is safer but can be slower to utilize on big amounts of food waste since you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company supplies a summary of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
