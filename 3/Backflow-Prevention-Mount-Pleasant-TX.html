The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>When you are experiencing problems with your hot water heater, you will want to make certain the problem is quickly dealt with to limit the interruption to your day and lower any possible damage from the problem.
