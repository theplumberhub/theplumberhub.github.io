<p>I can't state enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a very brief quantity of time due to closing on a home sale.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
