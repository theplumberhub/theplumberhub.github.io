<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
