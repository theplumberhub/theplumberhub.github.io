<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of illness or illness.</p>
