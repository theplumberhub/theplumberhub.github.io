Check for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten up as required. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as preferred.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are correctly maintained. Making certain the brine tank never lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise protect the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
