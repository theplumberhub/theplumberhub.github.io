Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
