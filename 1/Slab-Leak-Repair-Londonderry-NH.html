<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
