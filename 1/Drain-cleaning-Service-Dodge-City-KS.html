<p>The usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually struggles with rust and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

More handy homeowners may wish to take on waste disposal unit problems by themselves. However, if you wish to guarantee a precise repair or installation, call our licensed plumbers for assistance.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
