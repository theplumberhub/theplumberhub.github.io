<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
