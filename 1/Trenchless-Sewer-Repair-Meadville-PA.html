It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water.

Sufficient drainage must also be supplied.</p>

The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
