Inspecting the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak somewhere and this could be major problem if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home must have water.

<p>Our group at All Stage Plumbing also uses drain cleaning innovation to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and outstanding alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and imperfections.

Once the procedure is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to ensure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
