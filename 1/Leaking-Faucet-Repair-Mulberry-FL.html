<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve becomes part of the system for that precise reason. But while small drips must not be trigger for concern, property owners should watch on the water heater leaks. I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we required a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was professional and friendly. He likewise finished the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was less expensive than I anticipated. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
