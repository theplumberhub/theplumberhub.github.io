<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply.

Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
