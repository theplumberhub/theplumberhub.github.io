<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
