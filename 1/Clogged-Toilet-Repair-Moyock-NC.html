<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions.
