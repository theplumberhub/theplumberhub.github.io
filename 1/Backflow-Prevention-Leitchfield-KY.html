<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping.

Another pointer to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils.
