The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
