<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed effectively (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
