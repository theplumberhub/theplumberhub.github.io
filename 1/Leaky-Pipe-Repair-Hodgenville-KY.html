Installations must just be performed by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
<p>Bought middle ground stainless-steel blade design available at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for 2 guys.

The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.
