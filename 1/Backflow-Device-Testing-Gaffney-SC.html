Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>When pipes are set up into a vertical form it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this setup the loop should be greater than 33 feet to work properly. When created by doing this it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water supply.
