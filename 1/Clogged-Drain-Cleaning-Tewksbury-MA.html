<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>In truth, that's how difficult water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this sort of water leaves. With time these deposits can accumulate, clog, and even corrode pipes and cause significant plumbing problems.

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regrow after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
