<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To preserve your house, security, and health comfort, we use just the best piping: polyethylene. Lots of houses and businesses use galvanized pipes for water flow, which tend to degrade and can negatively affect our health.
