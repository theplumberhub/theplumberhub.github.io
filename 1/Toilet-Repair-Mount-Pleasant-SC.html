<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread significantly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual houses, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the public water supply.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is a great option for most people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only alternative. Repiping is the process of replacing old corroded pipes with lasting and long lasting new pipes. Since of their resilience and other factors, the new pipes that are used are typically made of copper. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
