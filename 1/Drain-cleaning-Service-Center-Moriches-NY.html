It is very important that the repair specialist knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
