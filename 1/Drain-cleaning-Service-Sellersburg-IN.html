<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
