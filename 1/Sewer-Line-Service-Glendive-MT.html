Sediment Build-Up: If you see weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this might be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>In time, like any other device in your house, your garbage disposal. might require repairs. A disposal system might begin or clog to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, use. A leak somewhere in the system might show a used seal. In some cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the whole system. This is where the UPC really comes into play.
