<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt.

If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
