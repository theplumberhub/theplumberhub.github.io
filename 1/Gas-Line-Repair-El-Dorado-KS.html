Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
