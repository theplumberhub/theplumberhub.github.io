<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>
