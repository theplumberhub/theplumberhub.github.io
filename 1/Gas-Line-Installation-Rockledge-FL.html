<p>The typical option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.
