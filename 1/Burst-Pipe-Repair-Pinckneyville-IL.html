Generally, they start small and go undetected, and after time can result in large puddles below your sink and cabinetry. This type results in possible water damage. The majority of other types of leaky kitchen sinks which are frustrating but are generally fixed easily. Connection problems in between the faucet and water supply line or sprayer hose, and missing out on gaskets in between the faucet and sink are big wrongdoers.
