<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with hard water, you may not realize just how much it affects you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Hard water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
