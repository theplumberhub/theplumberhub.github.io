<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and scenarios that require backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is necessary for owners to notify the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial property, the District reviews the use of each new tenant. The correction must be made before water service is allowed if the current backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the home owner.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the significant offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can develop major drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the problem for normal house plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
