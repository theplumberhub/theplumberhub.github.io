Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

While this may operate in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same product as other pipes in your home, suggesting that trouble might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you assurance and prevent larger leaks down the road.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all instructions to enable the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a cautious cleaning.</p>
