<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

<h3>When To Call A Plumber New Canaan CT</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
