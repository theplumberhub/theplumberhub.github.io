<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
