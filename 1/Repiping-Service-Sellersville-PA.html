<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide.

If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities.
