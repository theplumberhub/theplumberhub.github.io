If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
