<p>A site plan (to scale or with measurements) of the facility consisting of a basic area map, name and address of facility, property lines, buildings, the size and location of public water main( s) and all fire and domestic water services, meter pits, backyard piping and hydrants, pumper connection( s), interconnections, and the area of the proposed backflow preventer( s).</p>
<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that opportunity.

With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
