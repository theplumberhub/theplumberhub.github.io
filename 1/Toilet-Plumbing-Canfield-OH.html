<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Drainage problems can cost you money, hurt the environment, and seriously ruin your day so it's important to call us as quickly as you believe you may have a problem. We can offer you a quick assessment and not just fix your issue, but we'll make your pipes much better than brand-new and more resistant to damage in the future.

<p>A lot of common single family home systems will not need supply piping larger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to cost as well as steel piping's tendency to become blocked from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe in time once the internal galvanizing zinc finish has actually degraded. In safe and clean water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographic locations with destructive water impurities.</p>
