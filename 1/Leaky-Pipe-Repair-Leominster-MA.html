Some property owners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, particularly if you are dealing with a small drain clog. However, they are normally temporary fixes that do not provide long-term resolutions.</p>
