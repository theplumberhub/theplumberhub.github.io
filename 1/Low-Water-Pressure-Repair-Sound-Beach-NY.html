<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "difficult" depends on the presence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse results and are, in fact, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the refreshing flavor many individuals discover desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the effectiveness of soaps and cleaning agents. At this moment the water is said to be difficult.</p>
