Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
