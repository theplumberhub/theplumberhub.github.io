<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water supply and distribution pipes are frequently discovered with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever utilized today for brand-new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively pricey, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also exceptionally durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most commonly used pipe product for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
