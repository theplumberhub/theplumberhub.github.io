Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will establish.

<p>It's a strangely complex clinical procedure, however simple to treat. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and odors discovered in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium.

Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
