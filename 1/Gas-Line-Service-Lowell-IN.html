<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lowell IN 46356?</h3>
<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
