<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Sedona AZ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
