Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
