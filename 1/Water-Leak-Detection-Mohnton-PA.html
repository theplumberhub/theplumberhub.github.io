<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
