<p>There are a variety of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last permanently. It has been in place since your home was constructed so it is about the exact same age as your house. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and deterioration. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided excellent service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not just was he thorough and very professional but he had the ability to answer all my questions concerning the service. I would give 6 stars if I could. A camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most effective methods of finding the exact location of a plumbing issue. A plumber will place a specifically designed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to figure out where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>However, UPC design code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to attain the same level of defense as a commercial system. Increased protection is also needed when chemicals are added to a fire security system supplied by a drinkable water system. Remind them to avoid hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have children. Hanging on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily available in an emergency.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
