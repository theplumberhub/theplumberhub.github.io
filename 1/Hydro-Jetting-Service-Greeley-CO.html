<p>As the firmness in the water increases, so does the yearly cost savings. In a 40-gpg tough water market, salt cost savings alone can reach $1,144 each year. The majority of water looks alike - however inside a clear glass of water there thousands of liquified minerals which are entirely invisible to your naked eye. One glass of faucet water can have a high content of minerals - another glass of faucet water can have a low content of minerals.</p>
