Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
