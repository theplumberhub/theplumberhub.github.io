<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared detergent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature level to see if solidity had an effect on detergent cost savings. The research study included tests that got rid of challenging soils, in addition to assessing spotting and shooting. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes nearly 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up along with water at 10 gpg hardness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings increases to almost 70%.</p>
