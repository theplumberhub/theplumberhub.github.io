<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
