<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a couple of times, it's an excellent idea to have a professional assess your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to check your drain system. Often, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and identify the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company provides consist of check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and decreased pressure zone assemblies. Pointer: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, eliminate the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before mounting the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>
<p>Consider all the locations water streams in and out of your home. These are the areas that a professional assessment must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines must be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will get special attention, an experienced plumber looks to examine the total health of your system. That suggests testing for proper water pressure. After all, excessive pressure can damage your plumbing, and insufficient can leave your home with inefficient water home appliances.</p>
