<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit.

These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
