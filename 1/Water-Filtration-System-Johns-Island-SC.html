<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician turned off the water system and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to eliminate the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture.

A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>
