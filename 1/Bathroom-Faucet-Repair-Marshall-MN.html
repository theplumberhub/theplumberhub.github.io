<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification.

The water is continually heated as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being heated up if the tap is instantly switched off. The heating temperature is usually pre-set to fit your requirements and choices. Tankless electric water heaters use less power than standard water heaters because they only heat water when needed.</p>
<p>When pipes are arranged into a vertical form it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this setup the loop need to be greater than 33 feet to operate appropriately. When developed this way it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water system.
