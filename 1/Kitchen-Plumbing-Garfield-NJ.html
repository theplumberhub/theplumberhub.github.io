<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than items consisting of harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with known backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
