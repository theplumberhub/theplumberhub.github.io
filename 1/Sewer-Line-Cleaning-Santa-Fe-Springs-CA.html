<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but hardly ever stop to think of. Energy Effectiveness. Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is a good idea. The energy performance of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Aspect (EF).

You also have to consider the fuel source.</p>
<p>Bought middle ground stainless-steel blade model offered at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. brand-new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for 2 guys. There are numerous reasons you may need to call a plumber to come to your home and unclog drains.
