<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the public utility contains some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional costs.
