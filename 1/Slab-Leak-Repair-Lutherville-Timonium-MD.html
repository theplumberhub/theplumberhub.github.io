Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
