<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Little Falls NY</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is exceptionally crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system.
