<p>There's an excellent opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This corrosion can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Rusty pipes likewise cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>

The very best method to clear a clogged drain without damaging your pipes and plumbing system is to call a relied on local plumber at ABC. The pipe that links your sink to the main supply, consists of water at high pressures. A leak in this unit will be immediately noticeable.
