<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
