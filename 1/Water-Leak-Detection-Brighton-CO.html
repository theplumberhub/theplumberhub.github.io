<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. There's a good possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>The total cost for a gas line shut-off valve installation in an earthquake zone averages $200 to $600 per appliance. Each flexible earthquake shut-off valve averages between $100 and $300, and the typical labor cost to install one is likewise $100 and $300. Lots of house owners ultimately observe hair or soap scum collecting in their sinks. When not immediately corrected, the stopper or drain might end up being obstructed. As any property owner will know, clogged drains aren't the only problems that can pester bathroom sinks and faucets.</p>
