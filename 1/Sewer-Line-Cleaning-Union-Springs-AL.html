<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Union Springs AL</h3>
<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in avoiding scale formation in tough water systems. It is very hard to evaluate such claims, which are practically never based on tests that are well adequate described to allow others to evaluate them and to verify the outcomes. While the absence of "clinical" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the efficacy of a device, it needs to make one be reluctant to accept it without some warranty of performance.</p>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components. To avoid rust from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod safeguards the tank by attracting damaging materials.
