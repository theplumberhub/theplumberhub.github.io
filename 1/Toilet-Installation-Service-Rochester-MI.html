<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the potable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems.

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>

<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than changing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to safeguard the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
