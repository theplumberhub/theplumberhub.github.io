<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Germantown WI</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a house is since there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and quite cheap to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow, ultimately causing a backup. This included with other particles in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>
