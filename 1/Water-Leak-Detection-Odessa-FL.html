<h3>Frozen Pips in Odessa Florida</h2>
<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the potable system supplying the makeup water.

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
