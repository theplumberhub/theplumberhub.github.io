<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively short. Soft or crisp foods are fine, however hard or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, scouring twist-ties and pads.

<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash market.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
