<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly simple system, regardless of their significance. The majority of commercial usage backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your company, where irrigation meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the motion of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This ensures that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems remains disconnected from clean" water.</p>
