<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical service, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
