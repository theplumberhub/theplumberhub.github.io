<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you do not get that opportunity.

A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
