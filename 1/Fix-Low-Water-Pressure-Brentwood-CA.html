<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
