<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully because difficult water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use a growing number of detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated during regrowth. Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
