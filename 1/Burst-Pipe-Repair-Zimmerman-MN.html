Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
