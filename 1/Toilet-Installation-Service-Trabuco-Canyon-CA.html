<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted correctly (Photo 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
