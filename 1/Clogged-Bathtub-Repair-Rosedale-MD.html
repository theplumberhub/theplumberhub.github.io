<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are particular impurities that homeowners are handling and an RO can help minimize those concerns. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or temporary connection in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
