Copper piping avoids bacteria from growing inside of the pipe offering healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic product that is both flexible and lightweight. This material is resistant against rust and will help improve water pressure.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
