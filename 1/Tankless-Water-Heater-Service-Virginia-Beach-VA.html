<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

Toilet leaks around the base can likewise occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>

A plumber will check for indications of leakages, loose faucets, scale buildup on showerheads, water shutoffs and supply of water lines. Bill Howe advises replacing old water turned off valves under sinks and behind toilets every 5-7 years. Burst water shutoffs are among the leading causes of house flooding.</p>
