Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
