Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a steady and safe area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You must wait till after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You must also inspect to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
