<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
