<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Menominee MI 49858</h3>
<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 made use of to eliminate wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the oldest known examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly detachable and replaceable segments, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
