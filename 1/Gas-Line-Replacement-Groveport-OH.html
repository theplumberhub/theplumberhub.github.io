<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
