When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
