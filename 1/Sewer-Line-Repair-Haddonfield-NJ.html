It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
