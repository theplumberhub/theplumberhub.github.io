Got a little local plumber who overcharged me, I believe. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for 2 guys.

<p>For nonemergency jobs-- a remodel or remedial work on your plumbing-- you need a pro who understands residential-system style and knows the code in your area. He also needs to have the ability to work in a completed environment. That implies putting down a piece of scrap carpeting to safeguard floorings and cutting precise, easy-to-repair holes in walls, and, then, only when necessary.</p>
<p>While you can fix some toilet problems yourself, many are challenging or point to more complicated concerns than what you see on the surface.

It's always best to call in a professional plumber for toilet repairs and replacements.</p>
