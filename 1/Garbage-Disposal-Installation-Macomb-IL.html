<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
