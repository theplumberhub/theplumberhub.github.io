<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
