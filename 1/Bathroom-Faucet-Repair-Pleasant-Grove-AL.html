<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Consider all the locations water flows in and out of your home. These are the areas that a professional assessment ought to cover.

That indicates testing for correct water pressure. After all, too much pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water appliances.</p>
