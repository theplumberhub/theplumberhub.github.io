<p>Numerous property owners believe their energy companies or house owners insurance coverage is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the reality is that in a lot of cases you, the house owner, are responsible. The majority of fundamental homeowners insurance plan and local energy companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems around your home.</p>
