<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Whiteville NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
