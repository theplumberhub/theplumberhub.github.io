<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective working a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
