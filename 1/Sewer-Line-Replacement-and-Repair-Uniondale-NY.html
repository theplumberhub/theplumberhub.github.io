Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
