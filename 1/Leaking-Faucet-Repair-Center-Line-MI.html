<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective working a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process.

When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
