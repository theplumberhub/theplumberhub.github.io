<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
