The direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anyone who inhales it requires instant medical attention.

To avoid this disaster, ensure to use your gas ranges precisely as instructed and never to utilize them to warm your home. The exact same goes for portable gas stoves, which are to be used outdoors only and not inside. When running the space-heaters, ensure somebody is awake to monitor them.
