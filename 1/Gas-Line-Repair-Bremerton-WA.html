The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
