<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and duty are incredibly crucial to constructing a track record for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water supply within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
