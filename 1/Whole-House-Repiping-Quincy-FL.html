<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or illness.</p>
