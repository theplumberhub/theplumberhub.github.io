<p>3. Solar Salt originates from vaporized seawater and might often leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink film is actually a harmless bacteria that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to among the other two types of salts. As soon as the new salt has had an opportunity to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
