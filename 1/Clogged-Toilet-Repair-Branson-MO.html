<p>The very best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities website is by installing a pressure minimizing valve (PRV).

<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs are subject to routine and initial testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued functional efficiency. Such testing should be performed by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also offered online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Info ).</p>
