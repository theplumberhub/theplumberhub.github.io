If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a timely manner, the opportunities are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>

A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts break, they lead to small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can become worn and corroded, leading to leaks. Depending upon the intensity of the circumstance, only one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be removed and changed. Elements involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>
