The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
