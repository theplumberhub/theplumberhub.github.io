<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. Since of the tight area, the pipes typically make unusual gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, leading to the odd sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Often, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less thorough plumbers. So, you'll see the very same problems cropping up once again and again, despite the fact that you have actually had them fixed.
