<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
