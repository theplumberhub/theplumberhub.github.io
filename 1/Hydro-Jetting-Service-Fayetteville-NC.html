The direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anybody who inhales it requires immediate medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 individuals passed away from carbon monoxide gas poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this catastrophe, make certain to utilize your gas stoves exactly as instructed and never to use them to warm your home.
