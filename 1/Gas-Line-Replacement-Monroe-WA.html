<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection provides inspection services for all industrial and commercial structures, and verifies compliance with the electrical code.
