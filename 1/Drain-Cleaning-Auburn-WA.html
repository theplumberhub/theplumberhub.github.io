<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing.
