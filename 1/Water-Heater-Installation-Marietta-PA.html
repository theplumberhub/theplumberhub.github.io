<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
