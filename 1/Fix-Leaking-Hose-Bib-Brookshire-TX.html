<p>Water heater diagnostics: We determine what is incorrect with your hot water heater, in addition to what maintenance work needs to be carried out moving forward. Water softeners generally utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble damp sand.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Shortened to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where hardness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are microscopic and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regrowth.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
