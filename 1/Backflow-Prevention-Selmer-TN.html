Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
