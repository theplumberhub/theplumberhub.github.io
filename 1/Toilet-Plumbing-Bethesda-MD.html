<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>The White Glove Health & Security Plumbing Inspection covers over 100 items in the normal house plumbing system. It is a FREE service with an Abacus Club Subscription (a $200 value). You do not have to do a thing! We'll remind you when it's time for your annual plumbing inspection. There is no easier way to keep your home's plumbing system running at peak efficiency.</p>
<p>You probably know one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, bathtubs, and sinks to a local water treatment center. When drains are working properly that's really all you need to understand about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the competence to identify a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can attempt dumping a tray of ice down the drain, and after that switch on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it as well. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, broken sink? No issue is undue for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing group does the job rapidly and cost effectively.</p>
