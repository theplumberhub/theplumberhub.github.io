<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see however rarely stop to think about. Energy Efficiency. Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is a good idea. The energy efficiency of a storage hot water heater is suggested by its Energy Factor (EF).

You also need to consider the fuel source.</p>

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately experiences rust and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
