If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was constructed decades prior to that, opportunities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at ideal rates.</p>
