<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
