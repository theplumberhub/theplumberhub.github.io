<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Ellenboro NC 28040</h3>

Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
