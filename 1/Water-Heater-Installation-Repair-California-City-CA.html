<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies California City CA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>
