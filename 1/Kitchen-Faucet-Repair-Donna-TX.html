<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Gas is tough to spot, as it's a colorless, odor-free substance. We utilize natural gas in our homes with gas heaters, ovens, and ranges.

Using the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
