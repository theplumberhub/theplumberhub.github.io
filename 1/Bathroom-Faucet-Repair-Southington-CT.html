At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Southington CT</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
