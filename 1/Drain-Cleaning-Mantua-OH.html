<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are naturally more worried about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they utilize water from any offered source to attain their goal, but fire department vehicles frequently bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Galvanized steel potable supply of water and distribution pipes are typically found with small pipe sizes from 3‚ÅÑ8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom utilized today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
