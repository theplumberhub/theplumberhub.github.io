<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
