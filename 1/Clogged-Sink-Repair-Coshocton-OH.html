<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
