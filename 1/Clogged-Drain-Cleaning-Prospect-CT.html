Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
