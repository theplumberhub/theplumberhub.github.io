<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Burlington WA</h3>
<p>The most effective method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively maintained. Making sure the brine tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise safeguard the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regeneration cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
