<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
