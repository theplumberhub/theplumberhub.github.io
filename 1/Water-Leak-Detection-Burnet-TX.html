<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>

Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and attract salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press tough water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
