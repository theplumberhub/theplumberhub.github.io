<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Cape Elizabeth ME</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>
