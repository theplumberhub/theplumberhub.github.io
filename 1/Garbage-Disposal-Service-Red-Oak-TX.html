It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.
