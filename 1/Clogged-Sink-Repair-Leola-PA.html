<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Usage of tankless systems in 2nd houses removes dangers of water damage.
