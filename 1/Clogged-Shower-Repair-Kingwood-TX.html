If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimum rates if your house was built years before that.</p>
<p>Toilet flush manages are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Typically manages are toilet parts that get loose or corroded and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down appropriately. It's an easy repair, but there's a trick to getting the flush handle out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Photo 1). Then remove the old manage and lever, slide the new manage into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
