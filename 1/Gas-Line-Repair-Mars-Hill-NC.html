<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Company in Mars Hill</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and obligation are incredibly essential to building a credibility for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable supply of water within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
