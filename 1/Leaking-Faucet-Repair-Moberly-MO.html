<p>If you need a water softener is a personal choice, identifying. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
