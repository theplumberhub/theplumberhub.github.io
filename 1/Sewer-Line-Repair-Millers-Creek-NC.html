It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>

You can't always be particular whether the home has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner understood the reason for the clog A basic camera inspection might make you aware of a very expensive and concealed problem prior to the purchase.</p>
