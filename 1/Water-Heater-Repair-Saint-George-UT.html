<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative results and are, in reality, important day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the refreshing flavor lots of people find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and detergents. At this point the water is stated to be tough.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
