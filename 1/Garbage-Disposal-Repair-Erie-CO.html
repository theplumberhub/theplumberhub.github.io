<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Erie CO</h3>
<p>Faulty plumbing and components can be more than an annoyance: It can cost you cash in increased water expenses and trigger structural damage to your house. 10 percent of houses nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Repairing those leakages can save you 10 percent on your water bills each year.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
