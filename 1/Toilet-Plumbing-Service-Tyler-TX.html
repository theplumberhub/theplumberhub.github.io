<p>If you discover low water pressure or stained water, it generally represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop over time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
