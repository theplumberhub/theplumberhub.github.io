If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. You should wait until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth.

Another idea to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
