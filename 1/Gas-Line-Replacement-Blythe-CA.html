<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
