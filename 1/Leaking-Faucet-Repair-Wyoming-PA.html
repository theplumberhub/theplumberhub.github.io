<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>While you can fix some toilet problems yourself, many are difficult or indicate more complex problems than what you see on the surface.
