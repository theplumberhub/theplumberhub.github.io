<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Pulaski VA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
