<p>It is not always due to obstructions that stem inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are some of the most important features of a business. Customers can leave your organisation with a negative impression if urinals and toilets don't run properly. Leaking toilets cost cash, damage commercial home, and causes harmful slippery areas. Drainage is connected with possible health threats, including unpleasant smells and unsanitary conditions. A clogged toilet can provide a poor experience for your customers.</p>
