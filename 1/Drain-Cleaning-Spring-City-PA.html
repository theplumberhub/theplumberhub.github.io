Explore our water softener collection and enjoy better water for bathing and devices.</p>

<p>Debris such as foreign items - Objects such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become lodged between your drain and your pipes. These will ultimately obstruct the flow of your water prior to triggering a clog. Also, if excessive toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic products are flushed, a clog can happen. Thermostat concerns: The thermostat manages the temperature of the hot water heater. You may be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this component breakdowns.</p>
