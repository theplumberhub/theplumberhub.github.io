<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
