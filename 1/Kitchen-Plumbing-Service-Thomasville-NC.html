A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water supply.</p>

That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections make certain you are aware of every prospective gas line issue, and our repairs ensure your system is working completely once again.</p>
