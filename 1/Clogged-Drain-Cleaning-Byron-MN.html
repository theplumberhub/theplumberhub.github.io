<p>Water heater diagnostics: We determine what is wrong with your hot water heater, in addition to what maintenance work needs to be carried out moving forward. Water softeners typically use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are supplied from liquified salt chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most typical plumbing issues plumbers face, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is prepared to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware shop.
