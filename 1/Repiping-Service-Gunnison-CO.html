<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through already existing water facilities.</p>
