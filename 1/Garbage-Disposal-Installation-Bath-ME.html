<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you might need to switch bathroom tissue or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing companies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
