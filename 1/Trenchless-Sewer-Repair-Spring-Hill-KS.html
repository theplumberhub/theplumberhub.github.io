<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your house.

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger security assembly.</p>
