In the ion exchange procedure, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it concerns pipe repair, the most expensive aspects aren't the machinery or products utilized, but the landscaping, uprooting and yard damage that occurs.</p>
