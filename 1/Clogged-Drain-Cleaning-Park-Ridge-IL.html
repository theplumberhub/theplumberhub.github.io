Fixtures must be effectively caught, to avoid sewer gas from leaving into a structures. Warm water heaters are also examined to make certain that they have been installed effectively, to prevent a surge.</p>

The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
