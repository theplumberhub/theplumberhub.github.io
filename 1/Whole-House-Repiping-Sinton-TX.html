<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
