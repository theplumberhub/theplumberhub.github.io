<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
