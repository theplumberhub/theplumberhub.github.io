<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building contractors (or their workers). The secret to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
