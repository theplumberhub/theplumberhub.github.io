<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
