<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
