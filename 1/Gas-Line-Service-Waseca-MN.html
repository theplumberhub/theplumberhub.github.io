<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
