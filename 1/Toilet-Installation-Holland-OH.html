<h3>Main Line Leak Repair in Holland Ohio</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>

A plumber will insert a specially created water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to determine where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
