<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
