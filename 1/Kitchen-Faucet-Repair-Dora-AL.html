<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This rust can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes likewise lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable alternative to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
