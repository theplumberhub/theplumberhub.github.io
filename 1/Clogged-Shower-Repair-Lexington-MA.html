Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
