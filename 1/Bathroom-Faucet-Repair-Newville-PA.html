<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective working a necessity more than a need.

It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It is very important to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise trigger jams and blockages - think about composting or positioning these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can harden and collect in your drain too. After ending up cooking, think about putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
