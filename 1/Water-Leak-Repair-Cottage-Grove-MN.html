<p>Surface Area Accelerated Crystallization is a creation that imitates biomineralization, the mechanism typically recognized for structured development in the environment, including seashells.

Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
