<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the solution is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to solve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive solution is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to perform website inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a real or potential  cross-connection danger on a customer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are only carried out on Wednesdays.
