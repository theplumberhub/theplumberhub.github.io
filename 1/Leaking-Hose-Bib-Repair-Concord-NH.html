<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.
