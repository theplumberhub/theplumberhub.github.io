<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some clogs.

<p>Next, slip on the installing ring and snap ring. Tighten the three mounting screws, alternately tightening up each screw a couple of turns at a time up until the mounting assembly is evenly and tightly seated versus the bottom of the sink.
