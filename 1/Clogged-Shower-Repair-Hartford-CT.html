<p>Property owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is specifically prudent to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when purchasing a brand-new house.

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Next, slip on the installing ring and snap ring. Tighten the three mounting screws, alternately tightening up each screw a couple of turns at a time up until the mounting assembly is evenly and tightly seated versus the bottom of the sink.
