<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
