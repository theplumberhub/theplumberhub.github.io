<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
