Homes built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health threats connected with lead.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or short-term connection between a public water supply or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
