<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When sewer line breaks, it often causes the yard above it to end up being soggy. You might smell the disgusting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (ideally shoed feet!).
