<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

<p>A typical whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to 5 days, depending on the size of the home, how many levels it has and the chosen pipe product. During a repipe, plumbers will make strategic cuts in the drywall, totally replace the pipes, reinstall the removed drywall and patch it to remove any indications of damage or modification to your home.</p>
<p>For instance, if your hot water heater is continuously breaking down and requiring repair, a brand-new unit will save you money. Additionally, if you notice increasing energy costs from an ineffective unit, you will also conserve cash with a brand-new installation. We advise that all water heaters that are 10-15 years old be changed in order to conserve the property owner time and money in the future.</p>
