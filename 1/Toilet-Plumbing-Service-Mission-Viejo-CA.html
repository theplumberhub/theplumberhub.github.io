<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects.
