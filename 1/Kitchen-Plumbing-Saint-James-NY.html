<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening simply removes solidity minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can.

By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through currently existing water facilities.</p>
