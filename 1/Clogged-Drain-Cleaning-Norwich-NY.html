<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
