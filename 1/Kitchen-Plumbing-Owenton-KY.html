<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
