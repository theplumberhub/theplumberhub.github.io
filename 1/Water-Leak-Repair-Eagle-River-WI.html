<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
