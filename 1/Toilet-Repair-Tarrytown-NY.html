<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Outdoor plumbing for blockages or leakages. After inspecting whatever inside your home, your pro will then examine the outdoor plumbing.
