<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk security assembly.</p>
