<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
