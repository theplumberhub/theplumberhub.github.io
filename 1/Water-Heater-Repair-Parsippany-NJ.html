<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Parsippany NJ 07054</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
