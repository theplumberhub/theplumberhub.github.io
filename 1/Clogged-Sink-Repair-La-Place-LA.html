<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>

<p>Water could be dripping onto the pilot light flame. A leaking tank is a reason to call a water heater expert immediately. , if you regularly have backups make sure you have drain cleanouts to access your drain line rapidly..

<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain during backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the system). Each cycle will release 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you may not desire simply running outside. Not to point out plumbing code might be violated without proper backflow prevention.</p>
