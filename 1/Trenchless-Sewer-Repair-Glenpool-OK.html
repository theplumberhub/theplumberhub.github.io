<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply warm water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet needing warm water activates the heater and water is heated as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Due to the fact that they can hamper the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never be put down the garbage disposal.

The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and offer a cautious cleaning.</p>
