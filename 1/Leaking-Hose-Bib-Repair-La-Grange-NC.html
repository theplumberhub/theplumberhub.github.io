<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
