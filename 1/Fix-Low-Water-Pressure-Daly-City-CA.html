It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
