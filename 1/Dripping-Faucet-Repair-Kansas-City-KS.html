<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic man. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Although it may be tempting to pour in non-prescription drain-clearing products, lots of plumbers encourage against it. Not only are the chemicals toxic if exposed to human skin, they may likewise harm drain pipes if overused. There are extra concerns that may turn up, which is why our skilled plumbers will carry out a thorough inspection of your system to determine what has triggered it to breakdown. From there we can make an informed choice on whether your issue can be resolved by an easy repair or if replacing the waste disposal unit is ultimately the much better option.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
