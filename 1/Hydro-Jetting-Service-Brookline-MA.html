<p>Particles such as foreign items - Items such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become trapped in between your drain and your pipes. These will eventually block the circulation of your water before causing a clog. Also, if excessive toilet paper is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic products are flushed, a clog can happen. Thermostat problems: The thermostat controls the temperature of the hot water heater. You might be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this component malfunctions.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
