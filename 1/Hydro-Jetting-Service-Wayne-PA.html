<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.

A PE or RA can assist identify if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
<p>You probably understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bathtubs to a local water treatment facility.

<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a long lasting surface system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to use however requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>
