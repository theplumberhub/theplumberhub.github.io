<p>Typically, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by untrained or less extensive plumbers. So, you'll notice the exact same problems cropping up once again and once again, despite the fact that you've had them fixed.

<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
