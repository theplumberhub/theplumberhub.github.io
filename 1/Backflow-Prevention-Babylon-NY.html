<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners wish to get their hands dirty with. It requires more than simply elbow grease to fix broken sewer systems, and the trouble is typically due to how problematic it is to evaluate the damage. This is a lot more problematic if the damage is irreversible or requires more comprehensive repair, particularly in commercial settings.</p>
