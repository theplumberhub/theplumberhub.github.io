<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
