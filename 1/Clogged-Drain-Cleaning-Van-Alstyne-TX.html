<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for typical home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
