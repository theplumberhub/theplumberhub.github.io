<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace firmness ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other.

There is one other important component needed to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>

Hard water likewise makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions.
