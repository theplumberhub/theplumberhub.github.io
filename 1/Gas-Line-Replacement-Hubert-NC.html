<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Add more hot water if it slowly drains away as you work. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to try a brand-new method. Tankless units link directly to your plumbing and only heat the water as it is needed. This results in savings on your energy costs.
