<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to offer years of security. There are many local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water quality, temperature or turbidity can all trigger the assembly to weaken in its efficiency.

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
