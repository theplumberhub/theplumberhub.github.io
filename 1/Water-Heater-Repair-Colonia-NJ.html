<p>The Plumbing Inspections Workplace within the Department of License and Inspection Services is responsible for inspection, permitting, strategy review and enforcement for compliance with the New York State Plumbing and Building Regulations and all applicable plumbing codes of the regulations in the City of Buffalo. If the work set up by the permit holder is approved by the inspector, the permit holder if asked for, will get a Certificate of Acceptance from the plumbing division. If you're not comfy making electrical connections for your waste disposal unit installation, you can buy a disposal that currently has a cable connected. Ask at your house center or appliance store, or search online for 'waste disposal unit with cord connected.</p>
<p>High water pressure also damages plumbing. The water entering the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to take place without appropriate pressure reduction. You can also save on salt, water, and energy by using up to 50% less detergent for laundry and dish-washing, using up to 34% less salt and up to 35% less water during regeneration.</p>

Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
