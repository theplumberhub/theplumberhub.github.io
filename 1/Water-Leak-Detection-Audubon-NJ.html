<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>

Another pointer to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
