In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
